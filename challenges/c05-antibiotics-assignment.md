Antibiotics
================
(Your name here)
2020-

*Purpose*: Creating effective data visualizations is an *iterative*
process; very rarely will the first graph you make be the most
effective. The most effective thing you can do to be successful in this
iterative process is to *try multiple graphs* of the same data.

Furthermore, judging the effectiveness of a visual is completely
dependent on *the question you are trying to answer*. A visual that is
totally ineffective for one question may be perfect for answering a
different question.

In this challenge, you will practice *iterating* on data visualization,
and will anchor the *assessment* of your visuals using two different
questions.

*Note*: Please complete your initial visual design **alone**. Work on
both of your graphs alone, and save a version to your repo *before*
coming together with your team. This way you can all bring a diversity
of ideas to the table!

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: The data\[1\] we study in this challenge report the
[*minimum inhibitory
concentration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration)
(MIC) of three drugs for different bacteria. The smaller the MIC for a
given drug and bacteria pair, the more practical the drug is for
treating that particular bacteria. An MIC value of *at most* 0.1 is
considered necessary for treating human patients.

These data report MIC values for three antibiotics—penicillin,
streptomycin, and neomycin—on 16 bacteria. Bacteria are categorized into
a genus based on a number of features, including their resistance to
antibiotics.

# Visualization

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Prototype 5 visuals

To start, construct **5 qualitatively different visualizations of the
data** `df_antibiotics`. These **cannot** be simple variations on the
same graph; for instance, if two of your visuals could be made identical
by calling `coord_flip()`, then these are *not* qualitatively different.

For all five of the visuals, you must show information on *all 16
bacteria*. For the first two visuals, you must *show all variables*.

*Hint 1*: Try working quickly on this part; come up with a bunch of
ideas, and don’t fixate on any one idea for too long. You will have a
chance to refine later in this challenge.

*Hint 2*: The data `df_antibiotics` are in a *wide* format; it may be
helpful to `pivot_longer()` the data to make certain visuals easier to
construct.

#### Visual 1 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_formatted <- df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "antibiotic",
    values_to = "MIC",
    c(`penicillin`, `streptomycin`, `neomycin`)
  ) 

df_formatted %>%
  group_by(gram) %>%
  ggplot(aes(bacteria, MIC, color=antibiotic)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    scale_y_log10() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.1) +
    facet_wrap(~gram) + 
    coord_flip()
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.1-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 2 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_formatted %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = MIC, y = bacteria, fill = gram)) + 
    geom_col(position = "stack") + 
    scale_x_log10() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1) +
    facet_wrap(~antibiotic)
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.2-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 3 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
p <- df_formatted %>%
    filter(antibiotic == 'penicillin') %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = MIC, y = bacteria, color = gram)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1) +
      scale_x_log10()

p + labs(title = "Pencillin's MIC on different bacteria")
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.3-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 4 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
p <- df_formatted %>%
    filter(antibiotic == 'streptomycin') %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = MIC, y = bacteria, color = gram)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1) +
      scale_x_log10()

p + labs(title = "Streptomycin's MIC on different bacteria")
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.4-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 5 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
p <- df_formatted %>%
    filter(antibiotic == 'neomycin') %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = MIC, y = bacteria, color = gram)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1) +
      scale_x_log10()

p + labs(title = "Neomycin's MIC on different bacteria")
```

### **q2** Assess your visuals

There are **two questions** below; use your five visuals to help answer
both Guiding Questions. Note that you must also identify which of your
five visuals were most helpful in answering the questions.

*Hint 1*: It’s possible that *none* of your visuals is effective in
answering the questions below. You may need to revise one or more of
your visuals to answer the questions below!

*Hint 2*: It’s **highly unlikely** that the same visual is the most
effective at helping answer both guiding questions. **Use this as an
opportunity to think about why this is.**

#### Guiding Question 1

> How do the three antibiotics vary in their effectiveness against
> bacteria of different genera and Gram stain?

*Observations*

- What is your response to the question above?

  - Neomycin is more effective for negative gram bacteria strains since
    for 5 bacteria strains, the MIC value is lower than the 0.1
    threshold for effectiveness.

  - Penicillin is not effective for gram negative bacteria as it yielded
    high MIC values

  - For the Streptococcus genera, penicillin is the most effective

  - For the Staphylococcus genera, neomycin is the most effective, but
    penicillin and streptomycin are also effective.

- Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most effective** at
  helping to answer this question?

  - Visual 1

- Why?

  - Visual 1 gives a comprehensive overview of all the variables and
    shows the effective threshold of 0.1 MIC value.

#### Guiding Question 2

In 1974 *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*,
and in 1984 *Streptococcus fecalis* was renamed *Enterococcus fecalis*
\[2\].

> Why was *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus
> pneumoniae*?

*Observations*

- What is your response to the question above?

  - Looking at the three antibodies effect on *Diplococcus pneumoniae,*
    it is very similar to its effect on the bacteria in the
    streptococcus family. These bacteria are all also gram positive.
    This may explain why this bacteria has been renamed.

- Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most effective** at
  helping to answer this question?

  - Visual 1

- Why?

  - Visual 1 shows all three drugs’ effect on the bacteria *Diplococcus
    pneumoniae.* It also shows the effects of the drugs on the other
    bacteria so comparisons can be made relatively easily.
