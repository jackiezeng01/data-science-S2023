*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on a conceptual level. In this challenge we'll study a simple problem of structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won't have to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight** before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

# Setup

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

```{r setup}
library(MASS)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
filename_samples <- "./data/al_samples.csv"

```

*Background*: The [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material, internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge's data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy. The experiments were carried out following the highest standards of experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the "true" breaking strength for each sample.

```{r read-data}
## NOTE: No need to edit; load data
df_samples <- read_csv(filename_samples)
df_samples
```

Data Dictionary:

| Quantity       | Units |
|----------------|-------|
| Strength (UTS) | psi   |

### **q1** Visualize the strength data with a histogram. Answer the questions below.

```{r q1-task}
df_samples %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = strength)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15)
  
df_samples %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(strength))
```

**Observations**:

-   What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
    -   The mean is 40000 approximately
-   To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data has?
    -   The distribution is right-skewed.
-   Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
    -   Real because there is variability in aluminum alloys

# Assessing Structural Safety

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load `L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`---we simply compare this quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in the *limit state function* `g_break`:

```{r model-setup}
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### **q2** Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
df_samples %>% 
  mutate(g_break = g_break(strength), POF = (g_break <= 0)) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(POF), sd = sd(POF))

df_samples
```

**Observations**:

-   Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
    -   Yes, the mean of the probability of failure that we got is 0.
-   Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why not?
    -   It may not be the most trustworthy since there are only 25 samples for strength that we used.
-   Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
    -   Yes, as the standard deviation is also 0, meaning all of the values are 0.

## Material property model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to model the material property. This will give us the means to draw "virtual samples" and use those to estimate the POF.

### **q3** Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a `lognormal` distribution; if you didn't know that fact, then the choice of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to specify a lognormal distribution.

```{r q3-task}
## TODO:
df_fit <- df_samples %>% 
  pull(strength) %>%
  fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
  tidy()

df_fit 
```

Once you've successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted distribution.

### **q4** Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and `e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a lognormal distribution.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
set.seed(101)
n_monte_carlo <- 10000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- df_fit$estimate[1]
strength_sdlog <- df_fit$estimate[2]

# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
  ## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  mutate(g = g_break(strength)) %>% 
  glimpse()

## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```

-   Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced variability, or both?
    -   I think this is induced variability because it's generated rather than measured in real life
-   Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
    -   Yes
-   Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or less trustworthy?
    -   This probability is higher than that of q2 - more trustworthy
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
    -   Yes, since we generated random values
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
    -   Yes, since we are basing our 10000 generated samples from the 25 limited physical tests.
-   What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
    -   Higher Monte Carlo sample size
-   Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
    -   Yes, the confidence interval falls way

## A different way to compute the POF

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple problem we're studying, we can compute the probability directly using the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since `S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte Carlo as `POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`. Let's combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the POF.

### **q5** Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()

```

**Observations**:

-   How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
    -   It is slightly bigger than the Monte Carlo estimate
-   Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
    -   No. We're not generating this uncertainty based on the monte carlo.
-   With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation* be induced or real?
    -   Induced because Monte Carlo is generated
-   Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical tests*? Why or why not?
    -   Yes, it might not capture the full range of strength values as there are limited physical tests
-   With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited physical tests* be induced or real?
    -   Real because the physical tests are real

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with `plnorm()` we can't use a CLT approximation because it does not follow the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it's not a sum of iid random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a confidence interval via resampling.

### **q6** The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

**Observations**:

-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
    -   No because it doesn't use Monte Carlo approximation at all
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
    -   Yes, because the estimate_prof() function uses the limited physical tests as a base
-   Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
    -   Yes. Both the Monte Carlo and the CDF approximation say that it is less than 0.03
